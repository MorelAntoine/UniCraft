# UniCraft

Description
===========

UniCraft is a framework that aims to facilitate the development of a video game on Unity.

The framework supports both 2D and 3D and provides essential components and systems such as: character behavior, inventory system, note, etc.

UniCraft includes a library (UniCraft.Toolbox) to perform various actions such as: reflection, action on components or structures, etc., which you can also use for your project.

Information
===========

The framework is developed under the Unity 2018.1.2f1 version.

To see the current status of the project, check the "Projects" panel and then "Main board".

The documentation will be available when there are enough elements to build a V1. Nevertheless, each section has examples of uses for ease of handling.

> Additional information

I make this framework during my free time; I can not define and follow a constant pace of development. Also, if you encounter problems with the use of this framework, do not hesitate to let me know; I would rectify these problems with joy.
